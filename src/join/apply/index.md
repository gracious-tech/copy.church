# Join us
We're a collection of like-minded Christians who believe Jesus' command to "freely give" is to not just be admired but obeyed.

We seek to set an example for others to follow, and so we must be blameless in our faith and conduct, and already be actively giving quality resources. If that's you then we'd love for you to join us.

## Beliefs

We uphold the fundamental truths of the Christian faith, including:

 * __God__ is the only true god and exists in three persons, Father, Son, and Spirit
 * __Sin__ has left everyone subject to Godâ€™s wrath and condemnation
 * __Christ__ became man, died and came back to life, and ascended to Heaven
 * __Salvation__ is through faith in Christ alone, who paid the penalty for our sins in his death
 * __Scripture__ is infallible as originally given and our ultimate authority on knowing God and his will

We also believe ministry should be freely given, and so we *do not*:
 * Sell ministry (or ministry resources)
 * Seek to profit from ministry
 * Solicit donations in direct exchange for ministry
 * Restrict the distribution, adaptation, or translation of ministry resources

This perspective is not what people commonly think about when they refer to "giving for free", so it's important you [familiarize yourself with the theology](/explain/biblical/) before agreeing to it. We expect this freely giving ethic to apply to all aspects of someone's ministry, and not just parts of it.

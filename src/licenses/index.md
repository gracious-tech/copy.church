# Free your resource

It is very easy to free your resource from copyright. You simply need to attach a short note to your resource, no formalities or registration required. To completely free your resource and truly "give freely" you must dedicate it to the "public domain".

## Applying conditions
It is highly recommended to not apply any legal conditions to the use of your resource as:

 1. It would no longer truly be ["freely given" (Matthew 10:8)](/explain/biblical/)
 2. It makes it more complicated for people to legally use your resource
 3. The only way to enforce conditions is to [sue in secular courts (see 1 Corinthians 6:7)](/explain/biblical/)

An alternative is to simply state your wishes when sharing the resource. For example, you can express your hope that any translations would be freely shared as well.

### Legally enforced conditions
While resources with conditions can't be considered "freely given" in a strict sense, we do appreciate that many believers choosing to use such licenses have good intentions.

The following conditions are available:

 * __Attribution__ &mdash; Copies must credit you as the original creator
 * __NonCommercial__ &mdash; Copies can only be made for non-commercial purposes
 * __ShareAlike__ &mdash; Copies must be free to share just like the original is

You can select the license that has your desired conditions:

 * [Attribution](./cc-by/)
 * [Attribution + NonCommercial](./cc-by-nc/)
 * [Attribution + ShareAlike](./cc-by-sa/)
 * [Attribution + NonCommercial + ShareAlike](./cc-by-nc-sa/)

## Translations
If you won't be freely sharing your resource you should at least consider allowing it to be translated into other languages. You can do this via the Free Translate license which permits translations only (the resulting translation is then owned by the translator).

## Software
It is generally recommended to use a software license for sharing software, rather than a public domain dedication or a Creative Commons license. This is because of [complicated issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense#Reception) to do with copyright laws and patents. We recommend using the [MIT No Attribution](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit-0/) license, which essentially operates the same as a public domain dedication.
 * It's well known and trusted (especially the original MIT license)
 * It's accepted by companies and standards organizations
 * It has no restrictions (not even attribution)

However, there are [lots of other licenses](https://choosealicense.com/) to choose from, including copyleft licenses.

Software licenses are generally distributed with the software rather than linked to, so we don't provide a link for them. Rather you can optionally link to https://copy.church in the README to encourage other people to share too.


## NoDerivatives licenses
While Creative Commons does publish licenses that prevent modifications to your resource, we do not support such licenses. While Attribution/NonCommercial/ShareAlike conditions limit the contexts resources can be used in, NoDerivatives licenses limit the actual use of resources and prevent them from being adapted for different ministry contexts. Such conditions are too restrictive and too far from the biblical command to "give freely".


## Your responsibility
The dedications and licenses we recommend are permanent so that people can use your resource without fear of you revoking their permission. While you can stop sharing your resource yourself, you won't be able to stop others if they have already begun sharing it. Giving freely can often involve sacrifice and [we take no responsibility](/about/) for licenses used on this site, rather you must entrust yourself to the Lord.

We don't recommend sharing:
 * Personal photos and other very personal materials
 * Logos and other IP that identify you or your organization

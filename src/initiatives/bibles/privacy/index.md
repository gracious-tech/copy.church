# Offline use & privacy

The most popular Bible app in the world, YouVersion, hands your personal information over to some Bible translation owners when you choose to download the translation for offline reading. This is made clear in the user interface and in the YouVersion privacy policy. We note it here as a factor for comparison with other translations, and not to imply the practice is wrong in and of itself.

> The license agreements we have with some YouVersion Bible Providers only allow us to provide YouVersion users the ability to download certain Bible texts for offline use if we provide YouVersion Bible Providers with the Userâ€™s __name, email address, and country__ for future communication.

# Forbidding usage in openly licensed resources

Some Bible translation owners forbid their translations from being used in openly licensed resources. The reason for this has not been made clear (at time of writing). For example, [the license for the ESV](https://www.crossway.org/permissions/) states:

> The ESV text may not be quoted in any publication made available to the public by a Creative Commons license.

Openly licensing a resource has no affect on any content contained within it that is owned by a third-party, and it is possible some translation owners are not aware of this.

It should be noted that this restriction cannot nullify the right to still quote such translations under "fair use" law, so resources can safely ignore this restriction in many cases. However, it does reflect the will of the translation owner, and because of that we have chosen to voluntarily abide by it and not quote such translations in this website.

# We're building a collection of free modern worship music

<img src='@/_assets/ill_music.svg'>

# Be part of it!

We are in the process of building a collection of worship songs that are:

 1. Designed for congregational singing
 2. Faithful to Scripture
 3. Modern
 4. Free


## Why is this needed?

Up till now, churches have been limited to either singing old hymns or paying for licenses to sing modern worship music. For most churches that has not really been a choice. Almost all modern music is copyrighted and churches that don't want to be left in the past have had no choice but to pay royalties each year for the privilege of worshipping God through modern song.

There are several problems with this:

 1. __It creates a barrier to worship__ &mdash; Churches must pay hundreds and/or thousands of dollars and navigate copyright, licensing, and reporting requirements, to avoid worshipping God illegally.
 2. __Global allocation of funding__ &mdash; The Christian music industry receives billions of dollars and has created over half a million songs (of which most churches will use less than 100/year), while many parts of the world remain unreached and without Scripture in their own language.
 3. __Funding problematic ministries__ &mdash; Some of the most popular songs are owned by churches with problematic beliefs and/or practices, and get much of their wealth from other churches through song royalties.
 4. __Lack of accountability__ &mdash; The main licensing facilitator is a private for-profit company that doesn't publicly release financial statements, and many artists are for-profit as well with no limitations on how much they can earn for a single song.
 5. __It is incompatible with Jesus' command__ &mdash; "Freely you have received, freely give" (Matt 10:8)

We believe churches should have the right to sing to God without restriction, and to be able to do so with modern music. So we're partnering with a new generation of musicians who freely give their music, rather than commercialize it.


### But artists deserve compensation...
Yes, we greatly encourage financially supporting artists so they can give their music to the church for free. We are not opposed to biblical funding of ministry, but that is very different to selling it.

Our goal isn't to condemn existing artists either. Rather, our goal is to ensure churches have a realistic choice to sing freely if they wish to.


## Access the collection
The collection is in progress. Once we have a significant amount of songs available, we'll announce the collection as being ready to use.

Just send us a quick email if you'd like to be notified when the collection is available.

## Who can contribute
We welcome all artists, regardless if you have ever had a song published or not. As long as you own the rights to the song, you can submit it to our collection.

While we are primarily seeking congregational songs, you are welcome to submit other music too. But all music must be faithful to Scripture (not contradictory or confusing).

You'll need to ensure you own the rights and have already [freed the song](/licenses/) from copyright restrictions.

### What we need

We'll need the following:

 * Information (title, authors, year, language)
 * Lyrics
 * Sheet music (MusicXML preferred)
 * Sound recording (FLAC preferred)

### Promoting the song

In order to promote the song it is highly advantageous to also submit a video of the song being performed. This does not need to be a music video of professional quality. It can simply be performed by your church band at your church. But it must look and sound decent.

## Regarding rights
You must own the rights to a song (both lyrics and music) to be able to [free it from copyright restrictions](/licenses/), so we can add it to our collection.

### Brand new songs
If you created a song that hasn't been published yet, then you can free it yourself and submit it to us.

### Already published songs
If you have already published your song then you'll need to consult the legal agreement with your publisher as to whether they have exclusive publishing rights and what you might need to do to be able to publicly license it.

### Multiple artists
If you are not the sole creator of a song then you'll also need to get the permission of the other authors to be able to free your song. If you have changed the lyrics and/or music of an existing song, then as long as you did so legally it will be acceptable as well.

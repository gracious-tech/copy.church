# Opposing views

In the interest of good dialogue we are actively seeking opposing views, and will list them here.

## Criteria

 1. Must be specifically justifying selling/copyrighting ministry
 2. Must engage with a significant amount of Scripture
 3. Must be well written and at least 1,000 words

If an article or other work meets this criteria, we'll post it in full as is (or link to it).

## Submissions

So far we have __nothing__ that meets this criteria. We are especially interested in anyone who can answer the simple question "What forms of ministry can be sold?". Please [contact us](/about/) if you know of anything.

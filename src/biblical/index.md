# Biblical basis

This call for free sharing of resources for the sake of God's kingdom is firmly rooted in the Gospel and God's Word to us.


## Freely you received, freely give
We have all freely received God's grace in our own lives, and so it is only appropriate to freely proclaim that good news to others as well. However we are not merely encouraged to freely give in response, we are commanded to.

When Jesus told his disciples to go out and proclaim the kingdom of heaven, he commanded them to "freely give" because they had "freely received". This wasn't in relation to just preaching but also the other blessings that accompany the Gospel.

<BibleQuote passage='Matthew 10:7-8' :options='passage_mat10_7_8'></BibleQuote>

The implication being, a great many Christian resources, whether bibles, gospel presentations, books, worship music, etc. should be freely given. While this is hard to imagine today, it is only because we have become so accustomed to [the commercialization of ministry](/importance/#the-commercialization-of-ministry). For most of the church's history there was no copyright or sale of Christian teaching and worship. Present day circumstances do not excuse us from obeying this biblical command.

The exact scope of this command and what it applies to is a matter the church urgently needs to discuss.


## Ministry is to be supported, not sold
Giving freely doesn't mean one can't be compensated for the cost of doing so. In fact in the very passage that Jesus told his disciples to freely give, he also told them to receive the hospitality of those they preached amongst (Matthew 10:11). Paul also received financial support from some churches he ministered to (Phil 4:18).

So the Bible clearly affirms the right to financial _support_, however it does not necessarily affirm the right to _sell_ ministry. Many rely on Paul's defence of the right to financial support in 1 Corinthians 9 as justifying selling ministry. However, in doing so they are reading modern practices into the text. No one in Paul's circle would have been charging entrance fees, collecting royalties for music, or copyrighting letters. Rather, the sale of ministry is likely what he had in mind in his _criticism_ of others who tried to profit from ministry:

<BibleQuote passage='2 Corinthians 2:17' :options='passage_2cor2_17'></BibleQuote>

Paul's own ethic was to always preach the Gospel free of charge (and often be financially supported in doing so):

<BibleQuote passage='1 Corinthians 9:18' :options='passage_1cor9_18'></BibleQuote>

All the examples Paul gives of the right to finance in 1 Corinthians 9 are examples of _support_, not the sale of ministry. The pattern then throughout Scripture is that ministry is to be supported financially through donations and other means, but not sold.


## From secular law to Christian accountability
While the command to not steal is biblical, and copyright is an attempt to prevent a form of theft, it still relies on secular law and courts to be enforced. In other words, if you are relying on copyright to protect your resource then you'll also need to be prepared to sue and take someone to court to enforce it. Otherwise, someone could continue to share your resource without penalty.

Paul rebuked the Corinthian church for relying on secular law courts to settle disputes (1 Corinthians 6:1), and instead expected believers to be able to decide matters themselves (1 Corinthians 6:2), and when matters can't be resolved he said:

<BibleQuote passage='1 Corinthians 6:7' :options='passage_1cor6_7'></BibleQuote>

The behaviour encouraged by Paul then is to handle disputes within the church, and to not guarantee that all your rights will be respected but <q>Why not rather let yourselves be wronged?</q>.


## Servants of a common master
Believers are frequently referred to as servants in Scripture, servants of a common master. We have freely received from our master and are to work together to proclaim him. The early church lived out this vision:

<BibleQuote passage='Acts 4:32' :options='passage_act4_32'></BibleQuote>

However, modern Christianity has instead become a competitive commercial industry where servants do not share their master's resources without charging one another. And they rely on secular courts to protect the wealth the master has entrusted to them. We have severely strayed from the vision of Scripture and it's time to get back on track.


## More depth

This brief overview only scratches the surface of what the Bible has to say about giving freely. We recommend reading [The Dorean Principle](https://thedoreanprinciple.org/) which goes into much more depth.

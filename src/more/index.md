# More depth

While this site is designed to be succinct, others have written more extensively on the topic:

 * [The Dorean Principle](https://thedoreanprinciple.org/) &mdash; A book on the commercialization of Christianity
 * [The Christian Commons](https://www.unfoldingword.org/publications/the-christian-commons) &mdash; A book on how copyright affects the global church
 * [Letting Go](/letting_go.pdf) &mdash; An article that addresses fears related to openly licensing resources

They're all free of course...

# Why public domain?

In the legal world, the "public domain" is where truly free works live. Works that are out of copyright and can be used without any conditions.

The public domain is usually associated with old works with archaic language. But that is because almost all creators default to preserving the copyright of their works rather than giving it up, and so mostly only works that have had their copyright expire enter the public domain. But you can dedicate a resource to the public domain at any time, well before the copyright expires.

While copyright law varies by country and there are some complexities to it, dedicating resources to the public domain is the current best method of "freely giving" them. Copyright is automatic and so authors need to actively dedicate their works or they will remain restricted.

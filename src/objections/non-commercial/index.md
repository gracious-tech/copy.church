# Why not forbid commercial use?

Some licenses prohibit using a work for commercial purposes. For example, selling the work or incorporating it into another work that is then sold. Even if a non-profit organisation were to sell the work to fund other ministry, it would still not be allowed.

Since Scripture forbids commercializing ministry it will seem strange to support allowing commercial use of ministry resources.

Nevertheless, something is not truly "freely given" if there are any conditions to the giving, even non-commercial ones. While we should hope that others embrace the same free giving ethic we have, we should not demand it with the threat of a lawsuit.

# Jesus' command only applies to evangelism.

If Jesus' command only applies to evangelism, then it would be ok to charge for the following:

 * Baptism
 * Communion
 * Sunday services
 * Prayer
 * etc.

It should also be noted that the context of Jesus' command is him sending out his disciples to Israelites, not gentiles:

<BibleQuote passage='Matt 10:5-8'></BibleQuote>

If the free giving ethic were limited to that specific context (which it isn't) then it would be for people already following God.

Further, the command to "freely give" is in response to "freely you received", which is applicable to all forms of ministry and not just evangelism.

Finally, the command follows Jesus' instruction to not just proclaim the kingdom, but to perform miracles as well. The twelve disciples were not just to freely proclaim the kingdom, but were to freely give all the blessings that come with the gospel.

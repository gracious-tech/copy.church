Ministry resource creators should be funded the same way as ministers in churches are, through the financial support of God's people. This model allows them to receive the support they need while ensuring all their ministry resources are given free of charge.

Some creators won't need any funding. Many musicians create songs on the weekend while being employed full-time. Many authors are pastors employed full-time at their churches. But those that do need funding do have a biblical right to it.

Serving God does often involve sacrifice. If funds cannot be raised for a project then the author can decide if they are willing to still proceed with it at their own cost or whether it isn't wise to do so. But we should not resort to commercialising that which we have been freely given ourselves (the gospel).

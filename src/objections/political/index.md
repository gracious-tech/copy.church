All of this theology is derived from Scripture alone and not any ancient or modern political ideology. As such, all arguments stand or fall on what Scripture says.

The scope of this theology is also limited to ministry alone, so this is not a commentary on what should or shouldn't happen in the rest of society. This scope is derived especially from the context of Jesus' command:

<BibleQuote passage='Matt 10:7-8'></BibleQuote>

Thus the scope of this theology is the proclamation of the gospel and the blessings that come with it, which is usually summed up as "ministry". That which pertains to spiritual things. Not limited to occupational "ministers" but anyone who engages in ministry or creates ministry resources.

The reason for freely giving is also not primarily because it is what is best for others, but is grounded on the fact that we have all "freely received" God's grace. Jesus bases his command on what he has given us already, and not on any economic ideal.

These political philosophies have historically opposed Christianity and caused much suffering when pursued. They have nothing to do with the biblical ethic this site promotes.

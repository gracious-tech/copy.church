# Copyright fosters innovation.

Copyright is indeed good for innovation, as it motivates people to create new resources knowing that they will be financially compensated if it succeeds. If there was no copyright then no one would need to pay the creator for their work. Authors would be hesitant to spend a lot of time creating new resources if there isn't a good chance it will pay off financially.

However, unlike the rest of the world, Christians are not motivated just by financial gain or personal fulfillment but by serving their creator. Financial gain should never be of primary concern to us, and we can instead consider [other methods of funding](/explain/funding/) for it to still be financially feasible to invest time in new resources.

Copyright instead often slows innovation by restricting (1) access to resources and (2) the ability to improve existing resources (i.e. innovate).

Instead of thinking our way is best, we should have the humility to think "maybe someone will improve this in ways I never thought of". Others may need to adapt your resource to a new ministry context. Perhaps they need to shorten or lengthen it, or add extra material, or fix mistakes, or do something beneficial that is entirely unexpected.

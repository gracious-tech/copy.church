# Everything belongs to God and we can't give it all for free!

Yes, technically everything does belong to God, even our very lives. So it could be argued that we must give everything we have for free without exception. This would be like treating the early disciples' communal ownership of property as prescriptive rather than descriptive.

<BibleQuote passage='Acts 4:32'></BibleQuote>

It is not argued that everything must be freely given, but it is argued that all ministry should be freely given. There is an important distinction as ministry is to do with that which is spiritual and holy.

There is a distinction between common grace (what everyone receives) and saving grace (what only true believers receive). Likewise, there must be a distinction between that which is holy and that which is not. This is consistent with Scripture (which is itself holy).

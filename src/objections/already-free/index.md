# Lots of resources are already free.

Yes, there are lots of Christian resources that can already be accessed for free. However, that is not the same as having the right to copy them. For example, you may be able to listen to Christian music for free on Youtube but that doesn't mean you can use the song at church for free.

[Bibles are a very good example](/initiatives/bibles/) of how they can all be accessed for free _somewhere_ but cannot be freely shared.

Some resources are public domain which means they are free to use and to share. So you could for example just sing public domain songs at church and not have to deal with [CCLI](https://ccli.com/) and copyright. And there are [public domain Bible translations](https://fetch.bible/content/bibles/) available in many languages already as well. But in the real world very few people want to sing only old hymns at church, and most public domain Bible translations use archaic language.

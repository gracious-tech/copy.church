# Scripture only condemns greedy ministry, not all forms of profit.

There are a couple of passages that could be read this way, that it is only greedy or shameful profit that is condemned:

<BibleQuote passage="Titus 1:10-11"></BibleQuote>

<BibleQuote passage="1 Peter 5:1-2"></BibleQuote>

But there are other passages that just talk about profiting in general:

<BibleQuote passage="2 Cor 2:17"></BibleQuote>

<BibleQuote passage="1 Tim 6:5b-8"></BibleQuote>

It could still be argued that the issue is _seeking_ to profit rather than just profiting. So a minister could then profit from selling resources as long as that is not their motivation for creating them. It must then be asked why almost all ministry resources are sold using commercial practices that open up their authors to profit.

Why don't authors sell until the costs of their labor have been covered, and then stop collecting royalties after that? The way resources are currently sold allows someone to create a resource and then sit back and do nothing further as royalties continue to roll in for the rest of their life and their children's lives (copyright lasts 50-70 years after the author's death).

On top of that, Scripture also condemns the general commercialising of ministry, whether it makes a profit or not:

<a class='article-preview' href='/articles/commerce-condemned/'>
    <img src='/_assets/articles/commerce-condemned.jpg'>
    <div>
        <h3>10 times commercialising ministry is condemned</h3>
        <p>Many have tried to profit from ministry, including in biblical times.</p>
    </div>
</a>

Most of all, if ministry is to be "freely given" then there is no way to profit in the first place.

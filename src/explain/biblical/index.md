# Biblical basis

This call for free sharing of resources for the sake of God's kingdom is firmly rooted in the gospel and God's Word to us.


## Freely you received, freely give
When Jesus told his disciples to go out and proclaim the kingdom of heaven, he commanded them to "freely give" because they had "freely received". This wasn't in relation to just preaching but also the other blessings that accompany the Gospel:

<BibleQuote passage='Matt 10:7-8'></BibleQuote>


## Ministry is to be supported, not sold
The Bible clearly affirms the right to financial _support_, however it does not affirm the right to _sell_ ministry. Paul's own ethic was to always preach the Gospel free of charge, whether financially supported to do so or not:

<BibleQuote passage='1 Cor 9:18'></BibleQuote>


## From secular law to Christian accountability
While the command to not steal is biblical, and copyright is an attempt to prevent a form of theft, it still relies on secular law and courts to be enforced. Paul rebuked the Corinthian church for relying on secular law courts to settle disputes (1 Cor 6:1), and instead expected believers to be able to decide matters themselves (1 Cor 6:2), or otherwise to simply drop the matter:

<BibleQuote passage='1 Cor 6:7'></BibleQuote>


## Servants of a common master
Believers are frequently referred to as servants in Scripture, servants of a common master. We have freely received from our master and are to work together to proclaim him. The early church lived out this vision:

<BibleQuote passage='Acts 4:32'></BibleQuote>

However, modern Christianity has instead become a competitive commercial industry where servants do not share their master's resources without charging one another. We have severely strayed from the vision of Scripture and it's time to get back on track.

# Common objections

## People have a right to fair compensation
Yes, this is not a condemnation of fair compensation, rather it is a call to go beyond what we might have a right to in response to Jesus' generosity to us. It is important to financially support ministries, as long as the actual ministry is freely given.

Please also see the pages on the [biblical basis](/explain/biblical/) and [alternate funding](/explain/funding/).


## Most Christian resources wouldn't exist without payment
Imagine a world where all Christian resources are given for free, and the exact same amount of people who pay for resources donate the same amount instead. In other words, a world where the exact same funding exists, but it is given voluntarily rather than by legal requirement. In such a world, everyone would have access to the resources rather than just paying customers.

The barrier then is not funding but the hearts of Christians, to both give freely and freely support ministries financially.

## The command to "freely give" doesn't apply to today's Christian resources
If Jesus' command to "freely give" (Matthew 10:8) doesn't still apply today, and was just for his disciples, then it would be permissable to ask for money before telling someone about Jesus. Since that is obviously not permissable, the question is not __whether__ we must "freely give" but __what__ we must freely give.

Everyone can agree the basic message of the Gospel must be freely given, but Jesus didn't just have the basic message in mind when he told his disciples to "freely give". While they were to freely proclaim "the kingdom of heaven" they were to also freely "Cure the sick, raise the dead, make the lepers clean, drive out demons".

See [The Dorean Principle](https://thedoreanprinciple.org/) for further biblical reasons why giving freely should apply to all Christian resources and not just the basic Gospel message.


## You can already access resources for free
Yes, there are lots of Christian resources that can already be accessed for free. However, that is not the same as having the right to copy them. For example, you may be able to listen to Christian music for free on Youtube but that doesn't mean you can use the song at church for free.

[Bibles are a very good example](/initiatives/bibles/) of how they can all be accessed for free _somewhere_ but cannot be freely shared.


## Some resources are already public domain
Yes, some resources are already public domain. So you could for example just sing public domain songs at church and not have to deal with [CCLI](https://ccli.com/) and copyright. And there are [public domain Bible translations](https://fetch.bible/content/bibles/) available in many languages already as well. But in the real world very few people want to sing only old hymns at church, and most public domain Bible translations use archaic language.


## Just ask for permission
Yes, it is usually possible to ask for permission to use any copyrighted resource from the owner. However, here's why such an expectation is severely limiting in practice:

 1. The owner may not be contactable because they:
    * Don't respond
    * Take too long to respond
    * Changed address
    * Didn't publish contact information
    * Don't speak your language
    * Have died
 1. The owner may not grant your request because they:
    * Have too many requests
    * Have lost interest in the resource
    * Aren't convinced of your use case
    * Want more payment than you're able to give
    * Apply too many restrictions to your use
    * Only accept organizations (if you're an individual)

As you can see, there are many possible barriers to simply "asking permission", and these barriers are all possible for any resource your require. Now apply that to situations where you need to not just ask permission from one copyright owner but multiple. Bibles are an excellent example of this. There are thousands of Bible translations in the world, however a majority of them are under restrictive copyright. If you want to make a resource, such as a Bible app, that has as many languages and translations as possible, you will need to literally form thousands of legal agreements with hundreds of organizations. And each organization has a chance of either being uncontactable or simply not granting your request because of the reasons above. So it would take many years and intensive labour just to form such agreements.

Which is why there is only one Bible app available that has most of the world's Bible translations in it, and few other options.



## Copyright protects resources from corruption
While copyright can prevent someone making changes to your resource, there are public licenses that still preserve that protection such as the [NoDerivatives license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/).

Though even if you didn't preserve such restrictions, there are still other ways of preserving integrity such as with trademarks. For example, the popular Internet browser Firefox is open source and anyone can copy and change it but they can't call any copies "Firefox" or use the logo as they are trademarked. It can be the same with Christian resources and even the Bible as well. Even if a popular translation like the NIV were to allow changes, the name itself could still be trademarked and no one could call any modifications "NIV".

So copyright is not always needed to protect against corruption, and some public licenses still preserve that aspect of the copyright when it is needed.


## Copying is plagiarism
While the word "copying" can often be used with a negative connotation, that is not the kind of copying being encouraged here, rather "sharing" is more accurate but we often refer to "copying" in reference to copyright law.

Copying resources is also only plagiarism when they are "presented as one's own". Most licenses used to share resources require appropriate attribution. Public domain works do not require attribution and some authors may not even want to be acknowledged (rather glory to God), but there is still the social expectation to at least make clear when a resource is not one's own regardless of who the author actually is.


## Copyright is good for innovation
Copyright is indeed good for innovation, as it motivates people to create new resources knowing that they will be financially compensated if it succeeds. If there was no copyright then no one would need to pay the creator for their work and creators would be hesitant to spend a lot of time creating new resources if there's no guarantee they'd be reimbursed for their time.

However, unlike the rest of the world, Christians are not motivated just by financial gain or personal fulfillment but by serving their creator. Financial gain should never be of primary concern to us, and we can instead consider [other methods of funding](/explain/funding/) for it to still be financially feasible to invest time in new resources.

Copyright often instead [slows innovation](/explain/importance/#slowing-innovation) by restricting (1) access to resources and (2) the ability to improve existing resources (innovate).

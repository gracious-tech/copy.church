Have you considered going into ministry but have been put off by the thought of earning less than a secular career? Well such fears are unfounded as there are many ways to still earn significant wealth in ministry. We're not talking about televangelists either, you can still earn a profit and be accepted by even conservative Evangelicals.

Here's several options you can consider:


## 1. Start a private company and call it a "Christian organisation"

The advantage of a private company is that you won't have to reveal who owns it or how much money it makes. Christians generally think well of each other and rarely go looking for financial statements, so no one will be surprised if they are simply not there. This structure allows you to earn an unlimited amount of money. The more you serve churches the more you make!

::: info Case study: Christian Admin

Christian Admin has a complete monopoly on their area of expertise, so much so that many don't even realise they're a private company. Most Christians just assume they are the official Christian organisation for that area of service. They don't release any public financial statements and it's unknown who the shareholders are. They are certainly making millions of dollars and quite possibly billions, but we may never know...

## 2. Start a non-profit but keep bumping up your salary as it succeeds

A non-profit organisation can still make lots of money, but it can't distribute any of it to shareholders. However, there's nothing to stop you simply paying yourself a large salary. Most CEOs are paid very very well, and so if any questions are raised you can just explain that you are being paid the industry average. Even a below average salary for a CEO is several times more than regular employees get.

::: info Case study: Alleviating Poverty

Alleviating Poverty is a very large well known Christian charity that does good work in many countries, to bring vulnerable people out of poverty. They also have one of the highest paid CEOs of any Christian organisation, being paid $740,000 USD/year, which is more than 13 times the median US salary.

## 3. Sell a book or song and endlessly collect royalties

Christians generally believe that if you made something then you have the right to earn a profit from it. Even if the product is for ministry! So all you need to do is write a book or song and hope it sells well. There are many Christian publishers that will help you commercialise it and set the highest price that people will generally pay for. Most of the time you'll probably barely break even, in terms of the effort it took to create it. But if it does take off you could be earning millions, and rather than questioning your profits, Christians will praise you for your gift to so many people!

::: info Case study: Joshua Joseph
Joshua Joseph has written many best selling songs. He receives so much royalties from them he could retire early and give his music away for free. Instead, he continues to commercialise it, gathering money from churches far beyond the effort it took to write the songs.

## 4. Don't take a salary at your church to show your generosity
If you really do start earning a lot of money, eventually this may prompt concerns from pious believers. The best way to keep earning a significant profit and remaining godly, is to give up one of your income streams (usually the less profitable one). This will appear extremely generous to casual observers. For example, if you're a pastor and an author, you can give up your salary at your church. You won't need that financial partnership in ministry when you are already sustained by selling your books.

::: info Case study: Pastor Pots
Pastor Pots wrote an extremely well selling book and started earning millions of dollars. Instead of giving the book away for free, he continued commercialising it and dropped his salary from his church instead. Thus, instead of partnering in ministry with his church, he is selling ministry via his books instead.

## Finally...

Make sure no one misinterprets these passages to mean the way they actually sound.

> You cannot serve both God and money. &mdash; Matt 6:24 & Luke 16:13

> Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. &mdash; 2 Cor 2:17

> Freely you received, freely give. &mdash; Matt 10:8

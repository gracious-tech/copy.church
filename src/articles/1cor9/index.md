# 1 Corinthians 9 &mdash; Affirming payment for ministry or condemning it?

1 Corinthians 9 is commonly upheld as proof that it's ok to sell ministry, since in it Paul vigorously argues for the right to finance in ministry. And it's true. Paul _does_ thoroughly substantiate the right to finance with numerous examples, reference to the Law, and the conclusive statement that "those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel" (9:14).

However, there are two big mistakes that most interpreters of 1 Corinthians 9 make:

 1. Assuming the right to financial support includes the right to _sell_ ministry
 2. Assuming the right to financial support is the point of the chapter

The great irony is that we've been reading 1 Corinthians 9 upside down. Paul is not lifting up the right to finance to justify it, but for it to be all the more dramatic when he cuts it down with "__*But we did not exercise this right*__"! And he even does it twice to drive the point home.


## Context is crucial

1 Corinthians 9 is embedded within Paul's admonishment to the Corinthians regarding food sacrificed to idols (chapters 8-10). Many incorrectly assume that Paul has gone off on a tangent and miss that chapter 9 is integral to his overall argument regarding food sacrificed to idols.

While Paul acknowledges that we have the "right" to eat whatever we like, he admonishes that such a right should not always be exercised (8:9). He then goes on in chapter 9 to give an example from his own ministry of how he also must give up one of his rights at times (the right to finance).

The following terms are used in chapter 9 without much clarification from Paul as to what they are referring to, so it is important to read them in the overall context of the letter:

 * __"free" (as in freedom) / ἐλεύθερος__ &mdash; Paul uses this term earlier in the letter to refer to slaves being free from their masters (7:21), and a woman being free to marry whoever she likes (7:39). Thus, when used in 9:1 and 9:19 he is not referring to his salvation but rather being free from obligation to others, free to do as he pleases.[^free] Paul will later make the point that while he may be free from others, he is not free from the Lord (9:17).

 * __"right" / ἐξουσία__ &mdash; Critiquing the concept of "rights" is part of the purpose of Paul's letter. In earlier chapters he makes clear that one's "rights" are not always justified but can be detrimental to the gospel, in regards to sexual immorality (6:12) and food sacrificed to idols (8:9).

 * __"boast" / καύχημα__ &mdash; Paul mentions "boasting" throughout both letters to the Corinthians. He is very critical of human boasting (1:29), redirects it to boasting about God instead (1:31), and also uses it sarcastically throughout 2 Corinthians (especially 2 Cor 11-12). In 1 Corinthians 9:15 he also uses it sarcastically.[^sarcastic] While others really do boast, Paul instead humbles himself by not claiming his financial rights.[^humble]

 * __"reward" / μισθός__ &mdash; Earlier in the letter Paul talks about God rewarding people for their service (3:8,14), and so too Paul himself seeks reward from God rather than payment from men. While others may get a financial reward when preaching of their own initiative (9:17), Paul's "reward" ironically is to get to preach for free (9:18) and be rewarded by his master instead.


## 1 Corinthians 9 expanded

In light of this understanding, let's go through 1 Corinthians 9, with parenthetical expansions to help smooth out the flow of Paul's argument. These expansions work for any of the major translations, so feel free to apply them to your preferred translation.

The intention here is to help us recall what Paul means by terms, applying what we know from the context. We'll start from the last verse of chapter 8 for context:

<blockquote>

<sup>8:13</sup>Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again [despite having the right to], so that I will not cause him to stumble.

<sup>9:1</sup>Am I not free [_to exercise my rights_]? Am I not an apostle [_with rights_]? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you yourselves not my workmanship in the Lord? <sup>2</sup>Even if I am not an apostle to others, surely I am to you. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord [_thus I have the rights of an apostle_].

<sup>3</sup>This is my defense to those who scrutinize me [_when I tell you to give up your own rights_]: <sup>4</sup>Have we no right to food and to drink? <sup>5</sup>Have we no right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas? <sup>6</sup>Or are Barnabas and I the only apostles who must work for a living? [_Surely we have the right to support just as the other apostles do._]

<sup>7</sup>Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk? [_Nobody does._]

<sup>8</sup>Do I say this from [_only_] a human perspective? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing? <sup>9</sup>For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned? <sup>10</sup>Isn’t He actually speaking on our behalf? Indeed, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they should also expect to share in the harvest.

<sup>11</sup>If we have sown spiritual seed [_of great value_] among you, is it too much for us to reap a material harvest [_of lesser value_] from you? <sup>12</sup>If others have this right to your support, shouldn’t we have it all the more? [_Thus we deserve support from you more than anyone else does!_]

<mark>But we did not exercise this right.</mark> Instead, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ [_by expecting support from you_].

<sup>13</sup>Do you not know that those who work in the temple eat of its food, and those who serve at the altar partake of its offerings? <sup>14</sup>In the same way, the Lord has prescribed that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel [_through the support of others_].

<sup>15</sup><mark>But I have not used any of these rights.</mark> And I am not writing this to suggest that something be done for me. Indeed, I would rather die than let anyone nullify my "boast", [_lest anyone think I'm doing this for money_].

<sup>16</sup>For when I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because I am obligated to preach [_as God's servant_]. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!

<sup>17</sup>If my preaching is of my own will[^voluntary] [_like someone self-employed_], I have a reward [_receiving whatever I like_]. But if it is not of my own will [_which is the case_], I have been[^still] entrusted with a responsibility [_as God's servant_]. <sup>18</sup>What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge [_seeking reward from God instead_], and so not take advantage of[^use] my "rights" in preaching it.

<sup>19</sup>Though I am free of obligation to anyone, I make myself a slave to everyone [_giving up my rights_], to win as many as possible.

<sup>20-27</sup> [_Paul continues the idea of giving up rights for the sake of others and being self-disciplined rather than living as we please._]

</blockquote>

## 1 Corinthians 9 paraphrased
It can be hard to follow the whole chapter given its size, so let's now reduce this to a paraphrased version:

<blockquote>

I too could exercise my rights, such as my right to support.

As you know, I'm an apostle. Apostles deserve to be compensated for their labor, just like anyone else does. So we could have accepted support from you if we wanted to.

But we did not exercise this right! We'd prefer to go without than let money get in the way of the gospel.

We certainly do have the "right" to support, as God has always supported ministers through the offerings of people, in the temple and now as well.

But I have not used any of these rights!

(By the way, I'm not mentioning all of this to imply you should support me. I would rather die than have anyone think I'm doing this for money.)

I have to preach the gospel free of charge, as I'm not self-employed but rather a servant of God. My reward is getting to serve him and you.

So while we might be free to do as we please, we should still give up our rights for the sake of the gospel.

Application: Just as I gave up financial support to avoid hindering our sharing of the gospel with you, so you too should give up your right to food when eating it does a disservice to the gospel.

</blockquote>


## Alternate interpretations

Let's consider some of the most common alternate interpretations for this passage:

 * __Responding to criticism:__ Verses 1-6 sound very defensive and appear to be a response to criticism of Paul's apostleship and/or his financial practices. But they cannot be, as Paul was actually having a problem with people idolising him (1:12) and did not take any money from them (9:15). These introductory verses are rhetoric Paul uses to establish his "rights" making it all the more surprising that he doesn't make use of them.
 * __Personal choice:__ Some read Paul's giving up of finance as a personal choice that he does not necessarily expect of others, but that would undermine the point he is making. Is eating food sacrificed to idols a personal choice? It is not. It does depend on the context (8:9, 10:28), but the variability is due to gospel factors and not personal choice.
 * __Patronage:__ Some argue Paul wanted to avoid being controlled by the Corinthians were they to become his financial backers, hence Paul's emphasis on being free of obligation to others (9:1, 9:19). However, this doesn't fit with the context of food rights (chapters 8-10). It doesn't make sense of the Corinthians' desire to be _under_ Paul (1:12), since patronage assumes they wanted to be _over_ him. And it also requires a big assumption that Paul would be happy to be financially connected to the church in Philippi (Phil 4:18) but not the church in Corinth.


## The two tensions
This chapter is a challenging one to fully understand because Paul is holding two things in tension.

On the one hand, Paul is indeed justifying the right to support. When he mentions that the other apostles received support (9:5-6), he is not criticising them. It is all part of his argument that he too has the right to support just like they do. And Paul did accept support from other churches (Phil 4:18) and even requests it from the Corinthians at the end of the letter (1 Cor 16:6).

On the other hand, he will only preach "free of charge" (9:18) and will not let money hinder his ministry in any way (9:12). This is not a personal choice but a practice he expects everyone to follow, lest they too "hinder the gospel of Christ". Just as he has given up his financial rights, he expects the Corinthians to do the same in regard to food sacrificed to idols.

What we can conclude then is that the right to financial support is legitimate, as long as it doesn't get in the way of the gospel. Which means there are times it is appropriate and times it is not, and forms of finance that are appropriate and forms that are not. Conley Owens in [The Dorean Principle](https://thedoreanprinciple.org/) distinguishes between "colabor" (appropriate support) and "reciprocity" (inappropriate exchange), which is a helpful lens to see these matters through.


## A right to sell ministry?

There is a form of finance that is conspicuously absent in this chapter. Paul covers a range of occupations: apostles, soldiers, vinedressers, shepherds, oxen, plowmen, threshers, sowers, and priests. Yet the common occupation of a seller in a marketplace is missing, and for good reason.

The clearest passages on the right to finance describe it as "wages" (Luke 10:7, 1 Tim 5:18). But a seller does not receive wages, they receive payment in exchange for goods.[^shop]

Such reciprocity, exchanging spiritual things for money, is exactly the type of finance that "hinders the gospel of Christ". To sell ministry is to deny people access to it unless they pay. It is also the type of finance explicitly condemned by Micah (Micah 3:11), Paul (2 Cor 2:17), and Jesus (John 2:16) when used in the context of ministry.

Thus 1 Corinthians 9 does not support selling ministry, it condemns it.

[^free]: This is especially clear in 9:19, "Ἐλεύθερος γὰρ ὢν ἐκ πάντων" (Free, for I am, from all)

[^sarcastic]: It's clear he is sarcastic given he immediately follows "I would rather die than let anyone nullify my boast" with "I have no reason to boast" (9:15-16).

[^humble]: This is also how he also refers to his giving up of financial rights in 2 Corinthians 11:7 ("to humble myself").

[^voluntary]: Some translations render ἑκὼν as "voluntary", however "voluntary" can be understood to mean someone has "volunteered" to serve under an authority, which would mean they are not really "free" (9:1). Rather, Paul is giving an example of someone who _is_ free from any authority or obligation. Thus "of my own will" is a better rendering as it removes the potential for such a misunderstanding.

[^still]: Some translations render the perfect tense of πεπίστευμαι as "I am still entrusted", however the use of "still" can mislead readers into thinking it is in contrast to "but if not of my own will". In which case Paul would be saying that he is still entrusted with a responsibility _despite_ not preaching of his own will. When really Paul is entrusted with a responsibility _in accord with_ not preaching of his own will. Thus "I have been entrusted" is more suitable.

[^use]: "use" / καταχρήσασθαι &mdash; This verb is prepended by "κατα" which intensifies it (Garland, _1 Corinthians_, 2003, p427). Some translations read "not make full use of my rights" (NIV, ESV similar) which could mistakenly imply that Paul _did make some use_ of his rights. Other translations read it in terms of excess "not abuse my authority" (NKJV). This is more likely given the context. Paul is heavily implying it would be _inappropriate_ for him to "use" his rights, so "abuse" or "take advantage of" better capture the meaning.

[^shop]: While someone could be employed at a market stall and so be paid wages, that simply means the owner of the stall is the one receiving payment which is the same problem.

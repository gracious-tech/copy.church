# 1 Corinthians 9 &mdash; We've been reading it upside down

1 Corinthians 9 is commonly upheld as proof that it's ok to sell ministry, since in it Paul vigorously argues for the right to finance in ministry. And it's true. Paul _does_ thoroughly substantiate the right to finance with numerous examples, reference to the Law, and the conclusive statement that "those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel" (9:14).

However, there are two big mistakes that most interpreters of 1 Corinthians 9 make:

 1. Assuming the right to financial support includes [the right to _sell_ ministry](/articles/command-many-overlook/)
 2. Assuming the right to financial support is the point of the chapter

The great irony is that we've been reading 1 Corinthians 9 upside down. Paul is not lifting up the right to finance to justify it, but for it to be all the more dramatic when he cuts it down with "__*But we did not exercise this right*__"! And he even does it twice to drive the point home.


## Context is crucial

1 Corinthians 9 is embedded within Paul's admonishment to the Corinthians regarding food sacrificed to idols (chapters 8-10). Many incorrectly assume that Paul has gone off on a tangent and miss that chapter 9 is integral to his overall argument regarding food sacrificed to idols.

While Paul acknowledges that we have the "right" to eat whatever we like, he admonishes that such a right should not always be exercised (8:9). He then goes on in chapter 9 to give an example from his own ministry of how he also must give up his rights regarding finance at times.


## Terms in 1 Corinthians 9

The following terms are used in chapter 9 without much clarification from Paul as to what they are referring to, so it is important to consider the overall context of the letter.

 * __"free / ἐλεύθερος"__ &mdash; Should be understood to refer to being free from others to do as you please. Paul uses it earlier in the letter to refer to slaves being free from their masters (7:21), and a woman being free to marry whoever she likes (7:39).

 * __"right / ἐξουσία"__ &mdash; Critiquing the concept of "rights" is part of the purpose of Paul's letter. In earlier chapters he makes clear that one's "rights" are not always justified but can be detrimental to the gospel, in regards to sexual immorality (6:12) and food sacrificed to idols (8:9).

 * __"boast / καύχημα"__ &mdash; Paul mentions "boasting" throughout both letters to the Corinthians. He is very critical of human boasting (1:29), redirects it to boasting about God instead (1:31), and also uses it sarcastically throughout 2 Corinthians. In 1 Corinthians 9:15 he also uses it sarcastically to refer to the humbling of himself by not claiming his rights, which is how he also refers to it in 2 Corinthians 11:7.

 * __"reward / μισθός"__ &mdash; Earlier in the letter Paul talks about God rewarding people for their service (3:8,14), and so to Paul sees his reward for preaching as being the privilege of serving his God rather than being rewarded with financial "rights" (9:18).



## 1 Corinthians 9 expanded

In light of this understanding, let's go through 1 Corinthians 9, with parenthetical expansions to help smooth out the flow of Paul's argument. We'll use the Berean Standard Bible simply because [it's free](/initiatives/bibles/), but these comments also work for any of the major translations.

The intention here is to help us recall what Paul means by terms, and apply what we know from the context.

<blockquote>

<sup>1</sup>Am I not free [_to do as I please_]? Am I not an apostle [_with rights_]? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you yourselves not my workmanship in the Lord? <sup>2</sup>Even if I am not an apostle to others, surely I am to you. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord [_thus I have the rights of an apostle_].

<sup>3</sup>This is my defense to those who scrutinize me [when I tell you to give up your own rights]: <sup>4</sup>Have we no right to food and to drink? <sup>5</sup>Have we no right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas? <sup>6</sup>Or are Barnabas and I the only apostles who must work for a living?

<sup>7</sup>Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk? [Nobody does.]

<sup>8</sup>Do I say this from [only] a human perspective? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing? <sup>9</sup>For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned? <sup>10</sup>Isn’t He actually speaking on our behalf? Indeed, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they should also expect to share in the harvest.

<sup>11</sup>If we have sown spiritual seed [of great value] among you, is it too much for us to reap a material harvest [of lesser value] from you? <sup>12</sup>If others have this right to your support, shouldn’t we have it all the more? [Thus we deserve support from you more than anyone else does!]

<mark>But we did not exercise this right.</mark> Instead, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.

<sup>13</sup>Do you not know that those who work in the temple eat of its food, and those who serve at the altar partake of its offerings? <sup>14</sup>In the same way, the Lord has prescribed that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.

<sup>15</sup><mark>But I have not used any of these rights.</mark> And I am not writing this to suggest that something be done for me. Indeed, I would rather die than let anyone nullify my "boast" [_which is really me humbling myself_].

<sup>16</sup>Yet when I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because I am obligated to preach [as God's servant]. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! <sup>17</sup>If my preaching is voluntary [_which it isn't_], I have a reward [_being free to charge as I like_]. But if it is not voluntary [_which is the case_], I am still entrusted with a responsibility [_as God's servant_]. <sup>18</sup>What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge [_seeking reward from God_], and so not [_seek material reward and_] use up my "rights" in preaching it.

<sup>19</sup>Though I am free of obligation to anyone, I make myself a slave to everyone [_giving up my rights_], to win as many as possible.

<sup>20-27</sup> [_Paul continues the idea of giving up rights for the sake of others and being self-disciplined rather than living as we please_]

</blockquote>

## 1 Corinthians 9 paraphrased
It can be hard to follow the whole chapter given its size, so let's now reduce this to a paraphrased version:

<blockquote>

Am I not also free to do as I please?

As you know, I'm an apostle. Apostles deserve to be compensated for their labor, just like anyone else does. So we could have accepted support from you if we wanted to.

But we did not exercise this right! Because it would have hindered us sharing the gospel with you.

We certainly do have the "right" to support, as God has always supported ministers through the offerings of people, in the temple and now as well.

But I have not used any of these rights!

(By the way, I'm not mentioning all of this to imply you should support me. I would rather die than have mixed motives.)

I have to preach the gospel free of charge, as I'm not self-employed but rather a servant of God. My reward is getting to serve him and you.

So while we might be free to do as we please, we should still give up our rights for the sake of the gospel.

Application: Just as I gave up financial support to avoid hindering our sharing of the gospel with you, so you too should give up your right to food when eating it does a disservice to the gospel.

</blockquote>


## Alternate interpretations

Let's consider some of the most common alternate interpretations for this passage:

 * __Responding to criticism:__ Verses 1-6 sound very defensive and appear to be a response to criticism of Paul's apostleship and/or his financial practices. But they cannot be, as Paul was actually having a problem with people idolising him (1:12) and did not take any money from them (9:15). These introductory verses are rhetoric Paul uses to establish his "rights" making it all the more surprising that he doesn't make use of them.
 * __Personal choice:__ Some read Paul's giving up of finance as a personal choice that he does not necessarily expect of others, but that would undermine the point he is making. Is eating food sacrificed to idols a personal choice? It is not. It does depend on the context (8:9, 10:28), but the variability is due to gospel factors and not personal choice.
 * __Patronage:__ Some argue Paul wanted to avoid being controlled by the Corinthians were they to become his financial backers. There is little evidence this is the case and it must merely be assumed to be his concern. It also doesn't fit with the context of chapters 8-10 and also doesn't make sense of the Corinthians desire to be _under_ Paul (1:12). Patronage assumes they wanted to be _over_ him.


## So when _did_ Paul use the right to finance?

1 Corinthians 9 is not intended to be a clear definition of when it's appropriate to accept finance and when it's not. Paul is here giving an example of how he gave up seemingly all of his rights to finance when it came to the Corinthians up to the time of the letter. But he didn't explain exactly why he did so, only that he believed it would cause hinderance to the gospel in Corinth (9:12).

At the same time Paul did accept finance from the Philippians (Phil 2:18) and also invited the Corinthians to support him at the end of his letter (1 Cor 16:6).

So we must consult other parts of Scripture to deduce when exactly it's appropriate to receive finance and when it's not. Passages such as Matthew 10:8 and Micah 3:11 make it clear that _selling_ ministry is not an option. It is likely that Paul felt that finance from the Corinthians would have been seen as payment rather than support, hence his adamant stance in preaching the gospel free of charge (9:18).

Either way, what is clear from this passage is that Paul isn't justifying all forms of finance in ministry, he's reining them in.

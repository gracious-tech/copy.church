# Examples of resources
This is a non-exhaustive list of the most significant resources that have been freely given and/or openly licensed.

_NonCommercial licenses are usually not considered "open licenses" but are included for the purpose of this list._


## Initiatives
Groups that have formed with the goal of freely sharing resources.

Organization | Purpose
| - | - |
[The Copenhagen Alliance](http://copenhagen-alliance.org/) | Organizations with a common interest in making biblical language data free and openly accessible
[Open Components](https://opencomponents.io/) | Collaborative creation of open source Bible technology


## Bibles
Several organizations have openly licensed a large volume of Bible translations they own. Most of them are not in English (see [the bibles page](/resources/bibles/) for open English translations).

## Books & courses
Most free books are on the actual topic of generosity, and so there is still a big need for free theological and pastoral books.

# About this site
This is a collaborative effort of like-minded people who take seriously Jesus' command to "freely give". [Gracious Tech](https://gracious.tech) manages the site, in close consultation with other significant contributors.

## Contact
If you have questions regarding this site, feel free to [get in touch with Gracious Tech](https://gracious.tech/support/) or reach out to other contributors. Changes can also be suggested [on GitHub](https://github.com/gracious-tech/copy.church/issues).

## Beliefs

We are Reformed Evangelical in theology. We will publish any resources that attempt to interpret Scripture in a faithful way, even if we disagree with the conclusions. But we will not publish anything that directly contradicts or manipulates Scripture. Examples being:
 * Relativism
 * Prosperity theology
 * Non-biblical sexuality and/or gender identity


## Donations
We affirm the right to financial support for ministry, but like Paul in 1 Corinthians 9, we feel there are some contexts where it is best to even give up that legitimate right. So to ensure there is no confusion regarding the motives of this site, we do not accept donations for _Let's copy, church_. Rather, we greatly encourage you to consider financially supporting [those already freely giving](/join/).
